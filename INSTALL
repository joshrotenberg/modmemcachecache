Requirements
-----------------------

* Apache

I've been developing using Apache 2.2.4 and now 2.2.6, on recent
versions of both Mac OS X and Linux.

* apr_memcache

mod_memcached_cache uses apr_memcache routines for interacting with
memcached servers. apr_memcache is included in newer development
branches of APR-Util, but is not available in the current released
versions (up to and including apr-util-1.2.9). 

Your options are to install a more recent version of APR-Util from
http://apr.apache.org/, or install apr_memcache-0.7.0, available from
http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/libs/apr_memcache/


Building and Installing
-----------------------

Apache doesn't install mod_cache.h into a default include directory,
so you will need to add it to the include path as seen below:

    $ CFLAGS=-I/path/to/apache/src/httpd-2.2.4/modules/cache \
      ./configure --with-apxs=/path/to/apache2/bin/apxs \
                  --with-apr-memcach=/path/to/apr_memcache 
    $ make 
    $ make install
