mod_memcached_cache
-------------------

This module allows an Apache 2.2.x instance to use one or more
memcached instances for HTTP 1.1 document caching, in addition to/instead 
of the modules distributed with Apache for file and in-process memory caching.



Installation
-------------------

See INSTALL for details.


Configuration
-------------------
# in your httpd.conf, or including by it 

# load 'em up.
LoadModule cache_module modules/mod_cache.so
LoadModule memcached_cache_module modules/mod_memcached_cache.so

<IfModule mod_memcached_cache.c>

  # enable caching of anything below /
  CacheEnable memcached /

 # configure memcached servers to connect to. you can specify one or more per
 # line, andthese can be repeated if you
 # hate wrapping lines.

 MemcachedCacheServer localhost:11211 localhost:11212
 MemcachedCacheServer localhost:11211 

 # limit the number of servers that can be configured. if left out, 
 # mod_memcached_cache will just add all of your servers to the list. i'm
 # not sure this is useful, really, but its an option.
 MemcachedMaxServers 10

 # these four options control the number of persistent connections that will
 # be made to each of your configured memcached servers PER httpd child.
 # i haven't done a lot of testing here, so you may want to play around with
 # these a lot. if you are using the worker mpm, my guess is that having an
 # available connection for some larger percentage of the possible number
 # of request handling threads would be advantageous. 

 # again, these numbers are per httpd child process ...

 # min
 MemcachedMinConnections 10 
 # soft max
 MemcachedSMaxConnections 10
 # hard max 
 MemcachedMaxConnections 10
 # how long the number of extra connections will remain, in  seconds
 MemcachedConnectionTTL 10

 # these two allow you to limit (up and down) the size requirements for the
 # content of the item being cached, in bytes. note that memcached has a 
 # 1MB default maximum object size, so setting MemcachedCacheMaxFileSize 
 # higher than that without recompiling memcached to handle that size will, uh
 # be bad.
 MemcachedCacheMinFileSize 1
 MemcachedCacheMaxFileSize 1048576
</IfModule>
