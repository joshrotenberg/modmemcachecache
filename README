mod_memcached_cache
----------------

This module allows an Apache 2.2.x instance to use one or more
memcached instances for HTTP 1.1 document caching, in addition to or
instead of the modules distributed with Apache for file and in-process
memory caching.


Apache doesn't install mod_cache.h into a default include directory,
so you will need to do something like this when you run configure so
that it can be found:

CFLAGS=-I/path/to/apache/src/httpd-2.2.4/modules/cache ./configure ...
